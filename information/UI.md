1. Define the CLI Commands:

    Decide on a set of commands that users can run in the CLI to interact with SARAH. Each command should map to a specific functionality or task.

2. Command-Line Arguments and Options:

    Determine the required arguments and optional options for each command. Arguments are mandatory inputs, while options are typically preceded by flags (e.g., -f or --force).

3. Help and Usage Information:

    Include a built-in help command (sarah --help or sarah -h) that provides users with usage information for all available commands, their arguments, and options.

4. Interactive vs. Non-Interactive Mode:

    Consider whether SARAH will primarily run in interactive mode, where it guides users through tasks step by step, or non-interactive mode, where users provide all necessary inputs in a single command.

5. Consistent Command Syntax:

    Maintain a consistent and predictable command syntax throughout SARAH. Users should easily understand how to structure commands.

6. Command Output:

    Decide how SARAH will present output to users. It's common to use a tabular format, JSON, or plain text, depending on the type of information being displayed.

7. Command Examples:

    Provide examples of how to use each command within the help documentation. Real-world use cases can help users understand how to apply SARAH to their specific tasks.

8. User Prompts and Feedback:

    When running in interactive mode, use clear and concise prompts to request user input. Provide meaningful feedback about task progress and completion.

9. Error Handling:

    Implement robust error handling that provides informative error messages and suggestions for resolution. Include error codes or descriptions to assist users in troubleshooting.

10. Configuration Files:
- Allow users to specify configuration files or settings to customize SARAH's behavior, such as specifying server groups or default options.

11. Tab Completion (Optional):
- Implement tab completion functionality to help users autocomplete command names, arguments, and options, enhancing the CLI's usability.

12. Testing and User Feedback:
- Thoroughly test the CLI to ensure it behaves as expected. Encourage users to provide feedback on the CLI's usability and any issues they encounter.

Here's a simple example of what the CLI usage for a hypothetical "monitor" command might look like:

bash

sarah monitor [options] [server-group]

    monitor is the command for server monitoring.
    [options] could include flags like -c for CPU monitoring, -m for memory monitoring, and so on.
    [server-group] is an optional argument that allows users to specify a group of servers to monitor. If not provided, the command may default to monitoring all servers.

As you work on implementing the CLI, you can refer to various libraries and frameworks in Python and other languages that can help you build a robust CLI interface, such as argparse in Python.
