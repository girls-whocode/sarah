    ## Modular Structure:
        Organize SARAH into modular components, with each component responsible for specific tasks or functions. For example, you can have separate modules for server monitoring, user management, and software installation.

    ## Bash Scripts:
        Use Bash scripts for system-level tasks and automation, especially for tasks that involve shell commands and system utilities. Bash is well-suited for interacting with the command-line interface of Linux servers.

    ## Python Modules:
        Utilize Python for more complex tasks and interactions, as it offers a wide range of libraries and frameworks. You can create Python modules for tasks like monitoring server resources, handling RSA keys, and managing software packages.

    ## Command-Line Interface (CLI):
        Develop a user-friendly CLI interface that allows system administrators to interact with SARAH easily. This CLI can serve as the primary interface for executing tasks and managing servers.

    ## Modular Interactions:
        Ensure seamless interactions between different modules and scripts. For instance, the Bash scripts can call Python or Perl modules when needed, passing relevant data and parameters.

    ## Configuration Files:
        Implement configuration files or settings to allow administrators to customize SARAH's behavior, such as specifying server groups or defining monitoring thresholds.

    ## Logging and Error Handling:
        Incorporate comprehensive logging mechanisms in each component to record actions and errors. This helps in troubleshooting and auditing.

    ## Security Considerations:
        Prioritize security throughout SARAH's development. Apply best practices for secure communication, user authentication, and access control.

    ## Testing and Debugging:
        Rigorously test each component and script to ensure they function correctly. Implement error handling and debugging features to aid in troubleshooting.

    ## Documentation:
        Create detailed documentation for installation, configuration, and usage of SARAH. Provide examples and usage scenarios to assist administrators.

    ## Version Control:
        Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage the codebase, allowing for collaboration and tracking changes.

    ## User Feedback and Updates:
        Encourage user feedback to identify areas for improvement. Regularly update SARAH to address issues and enhance functionality.
