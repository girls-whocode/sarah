Purpose:
SARAH (System Administrator's Remote Access Helper) is designed to streamline and enhance the remote administration of a large number of Linux servers within your company. Its primary focus is on tasks related to server maintenance, user management, and software installation.

Goals and Features:

    Server Monitoring and Management:
        Real-time monitoring of server resource utilization, including CPU usage, memory usage, and available disk space.
        Automated alerts and notifications for critical resource thresholds.
        The ability to remotely execute system maintenance tasks like package updates and patches.

    User Management:
        Manage RSA keys for user authentication on servers.
        Simplify the process of adding, removing, or updating user access permissions.

    Software Installation and Updates:
        Allow for remote installation and management of applications and software packages across multiple servers.
        Track software versions and ensure consistency across the server fleet.

    Server Grouping and Task Sequencing:
        Implement a feature to group servers logically (e.g., by department, function, or location).
        Enable the selection of a group of servers for executing tasks sequentially or in parallel.
        Maintain a task queue and execution history for auditing purposes.

    Security and Authentication:
        Ensure secure communication and authentication mechanisms, such as SSH key-based authentication.
        Implement role-based access control to limit access to specific features based on user roles.

    Logging and Reporting:
        Comprehensive logging of all actions and tasks performed on servers.
        Generate reports on server health, resource utilization, and completed tasks.

    Scalability and Performance:
        Optimize SARAH for scalability to handle a growing number of servers.
        Implement performance enhancements to minimize resource overhead.

    User-Friendly Interface:
        Create an intuitive web-based or command-line interface for system administrators to interact with SARAH.
        Provide clear and user-friendly feedback on task execution and server status.

    Documentation and Support:
        Develop detailed documentation for installation, configuration, and usage.
        Offer responsive support channels for troubleshooting and assistance.

    Community Collaboration (Optional):
        Consider making SARAH open-source to encourage contributions from the system administrator community.

    Maintenance and Updates:
        Regularly update SARAH to address security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues with Linux distributions.
